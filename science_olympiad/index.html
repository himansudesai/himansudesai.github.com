    <h2>Definitions</h4>
    <h5>Epidemiology</h5><h6>Basic science of public health, high quantitative discipline 
based on principles of statistics and research methodologies</h6>
    <h5>Distribution</h5><h6>Frequencies and patterns of health events within groups in a 
population. Questions- who, what, where, when?</h6>
    <h5>Determinants</h5><h6>Causes or factors associated with increased risk or probability of disease. Questions â€“ how, why?</h6>
    <h5>Populations</h5><h6>Epidemiology deals with groups of people rather than with individual patients</h6>
    <h5>Control</h5><h6>Data steers public health decision making and aids in developing 
and evaluating interventions to control and prevent health problems</h6>
    <h5>Health-related events</h5><h6>chronic diseases; environmental problems; behavioral problems; injuries; infectious diseases</h6></h5>
    <h5>Outbreak</h5><h6> localized epidemic - More cases of a particular disease than expected in a given area or among a specialized group of people over a 
particular period of time</h6>
    <h5>Epidemic</h5><h6>Large numbers of people over a wide geographic area affected</h6>
    <h5>Pandemic</h5><h6>-An epidemic occurring over a very wide area (several countries or 
continents) and usually affecting a large proportion of the population</h6>
    <h5>Public Health Surveillance</h5><h6>The systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of health data to gain knowledge of the pattern of disease occurrence in order to control and prevent disease in the community</h6>
    <h5>Surveillance</h5><h6>The monitoring of diseases that have a certain analysis, interpretation, and reporting of health data.</h6>
    <h5>Epidemic</h5><h6>Large numbers of people over a wide geographic area affected</h6>
    <h5>Risk</h5><h6>The probability that something will cause injury or harm</h6>
    
    
    
    <h5>Vector</h5><h6>A vector is an insect or any living carrier that transmits an
